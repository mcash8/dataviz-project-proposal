# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the chess games dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess and a sleep efficency dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency 

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of the chess games dataset. It's a stacked bar plot and it shows the number of wins according to piece color and also how each game was won (ie: out of time, resign, check mate, or draw)

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 *  Is there an average win rate based on player ranking?
 *  Do both black and white pieces have an equal distrubution of wins?
 *  What opening moves are used the most?
 *  Is there a correlation between age and # of hours selpt?
 *  Are there any patterns with bedtime and deep sleep percentage?
 *  Task: Add a drop down menu for user selection of data to plot for sleep efficency dataset

## Sketches

The purpose of the donut chart is to visualize the distribution of wins among the different piece colors.

The second sketch would aid in answering the question: what opening moves are used the most? I think it would also be neat to add interactivity here and let the user select an opening move style and highlight the areas of the board corresponding to that move.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
