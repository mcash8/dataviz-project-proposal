# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the chess games dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess and a sleep efficency dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency 

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 *  Do both black and white pieces have an equal distrubution of wins?
 *  What is the average player ranking? What is the average number of turns in a game? 
 *  Is there a correlation between age and # of hours selpt?
 *  Does gender affect sleep efficiency?
 *  Are there any patterns with bedtime and deep sleep percentage?
 *  Task: Add a drop down menu for interactivity

## Sketches & Final Visuals

The purpose of the donut chart is to visualize the distribution of wins among the different piece colors.

Remarks & Changes From Plan: 
 *Added interactivity via a drop down menu and added other features to plot
 *Used a bar chart for visualization instead of a donut chart

The third sketch would aid in answering the questions: What is the most common player rankings? and What is the average number of turns in a game? In theory, the answer to this question should take on some distribution. This plot could also be interactive.

Remarks & Changes From Proposed Plan: 
*Used a histogram for this viz
*Added an input box so the user can control the number of bins used for the histogram

Finally, for the sleep dataset I'll use a bar chart and scatter plot. For this, I plan to make most of these graphs interactive and let the user choose the x/y data.

Remarks & Changes From Proposed Plan: 
*Couldn't get x/y data interactivity to work so I used a tooltip for the scatterplot 
*Added a drop down menu for bar chart 

## Future Work
*Create a heatmap/animated visualization of the most common opening moves in a match

The second sketch would aid in answering the question: what opening moves are used the most? I think it would also be neat to add interactivity here and let the user select an opening move style and highlight the areas of the board corresponding to that move.
