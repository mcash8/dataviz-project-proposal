# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the chess games dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess and a sleep efficency dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency 

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 *  Is there an average win rate based on player ranking?
 *  Do both black and white pieces have an equal distrubution of wins?
 *  What opening moves are used the most?
 *  Is there a correlation between age and # of hours selpt?
 *  Are there any patterns with bedtime and deep sleep percentage?
 *  Task: Add a drop down menu for user selection of data to plot for sleep efficency dataset

## Sketches & Final Visuals

The purpose of the donut chart is to visualize the distribution of wins among the different piece colors.

Remarks & Changes From Plan:

The second sketch would aid in answering the question: what opening moves are used the most? I think it would also be neat to add interactivity here and let the user select an opening move style and highlight the areas of the board corresponding to that move. 

The Final Visual: N/A

Remarks & Changes From Propsed Plan: I was unable to create this visual, this has been added to future work

The third sketch would aid in answering the question: What is the average win rate among different player rankings. In theory, the answer to this question should take on some distribution. This plot could also be interactive.

Remarks & Changes From Proposed Plan: 

Finally, most of the sleep data can be visualized as a bar chart. For this, I plan make most of these graphs interactive and let the user choose the x/y data.
